# Alfred Spotify Mini Player


This is "Spotify Mini Player", like the alfred built-in iTunes Mini Player, but for Spotify!


## Description

Speed is the key word here: instead of using slow Spotify API, it uses a local version of your library stored in a database(it includes everything inside *Your Music* and all the playlists you created and playlists that you're subscribed to). You can decide to search in *Your Music* only, or your complete library (all playlists and *Your Music*). You can browse by Artist, Album or Playlist. You can also lookup for artists online, search for lyrics, get related artists, get featured playlists etc..
You can also control Spotify using keywords such as play/next/volmax/random/shuffle/etc...
