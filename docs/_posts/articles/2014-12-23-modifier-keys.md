Alfred modifiers are specific actions you can trigger when pressing special keys when selecting a track:

* Select a track with `⌥` (alt key) to play the album

* Select a track with `⌘` (cmd key) to play the artist

* Select a track with `^` (ctrl key) to lookup the corresponding artist 'online'

* Select a track with `fn` (function key) to add the track to either _Your Music_, or any of your playlists (you can even create a new one)

* Select a track with  `⇧` (shift key) to add the album to either _Your Music_, or any of your playlists (you can even create a new one)

* Select a playlist with  `⇧` (shift key) to add the playlist to either _Your Music_, or any of your playlists (you can even create a new one)

* Select a playlist with  `⌘` (cmd key) to change the privacy (public or private)
