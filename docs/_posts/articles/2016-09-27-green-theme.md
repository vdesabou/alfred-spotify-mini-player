* You can switch to a green theme in settings menu:-

<figure>
	<img src="{{ site.url }}/images/green-theme1.jpg">
	<figcaption>Switch to green theme in <b>Settings</b>.</figcaption>
</figure>

* After some time (icons are downloaded from the cloud), you should have the workflow in green mode:-

<figure>
	<img src="{{ site.url }}/images/green-theme2.jpg">
	<figcaption>Green theme icons.</figcaption>
</figure>

Note: To get back to original version with grey icons, simply re-install the workflow (settings and library will be preserved)
