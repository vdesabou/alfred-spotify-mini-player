* You can search online, i.e not necessarily in your Library from the *main* menu:-

	<img src="{{ site.url }}/images/search-online2.jpg">
	<figcaption>Search Online in Main menu.</figcaption>
</figure>

* Then you can search for any track, album, artist or playlist by typing in the main window:-

<figure>
	<img src="{{ site.url }}/images/search-online3.jpg">
	<figcaption>Search for any track, album, artist or playlist.</figcaption>
</figure>

* You'll get all results, note that the number of results is controlled by the setting _Max Results_:-

	<figcaption>All results displayed.</figcaption>
</figure>

* You can also reduce the search by category, in this example only playlists:-

<figure>
	<img src="{{ site.url }}/images/search-online5.jpg">
	<figcaption>Search by category, here playlists.</figcaption>
</figure>

* Then you can browse directly the playlist, add the playlist to another playlist or you can even follow the playlist to add it in your library:-

	<figcaption>Browse directly in the results.</figcaption>
