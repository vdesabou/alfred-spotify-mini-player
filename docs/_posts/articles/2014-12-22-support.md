If you experience an issue with the workflow, follow these steps:-

* Before opening an issue, you can also have a look at the list of [known issues]( {{ site.url }}/known-issues)

* Use the `spot_mini_debug` keyword input (note that if an exception occurs, it is automatically called) and use _Send an email to the author_ option. This will generate an email with all information needed for troubleshooting.

* You can also open an issue on the [Github page](https://github.com/vdesabou/alfred-spotify-mini-player/issues/new). You can also use command `spot_mini_issue` to open the issue:-

**Note:** With the `spot_mini_debug.tgz`, I'll have access to your Spotify library (but not your Spotify password, don't worry :smile:). This is only for the time of investigation. Once investigation is over, you can regenerate a _Client Secret_, as explained in the [Spotify Application page](https://developer.spotify.com/my-applications):-
