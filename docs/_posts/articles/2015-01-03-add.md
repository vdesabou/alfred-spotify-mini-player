You can add (with duplicate detection!) any track, album or even entire playlist to either _Your Music_ or any of your playlists (the ones you own):-

* You can do it for current track in the *Current Track* menu:-
<figure>
	<img src="{{ site.url }}/images/add1.jpg">
	<figcaption>Add current track to ... in the Current Track menu.</figcaption>
</figure>

* Then you can choose to add it in _Your Music_ or any of your playlists (yours):-

<figure>
	<img src="{{ site.url }}/images/add2.jpg">
	<figcaption>Select an option to add the track.</figcaption>
</figure>

Note that the library is automatically refreshed.

* You can also add a complete album in the *Album* menu:-

<figure>
	<img src="{{ site.url }}/images/add3.jpg">
	<figcaption>Select to add complete album to ....</figcaption>
</figure>

* You can also add a complete playlist in the *Playlist* menu:-

<figure>
	<img src="{{ site.url }}/images/add4.jpg">
	<figcaption>Select to add complete playlist to ....</figcaption>
</figure>

* You can also invoke the Add feature from commands:-
