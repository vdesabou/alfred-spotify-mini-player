Setting up the workflow is easy, you just need to follow these steps:-

## Install PHP (MacOS Monterey and above)

PHP is no more installed by default starting from MacOS Monterey, so you need to install `php` from [brew](https://brew.sh) before using the workflow:

* Install brew: `/bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/install.sh)"`

* Install PHP: `brew install php`


## Download and install the workflow

* [Download](https://github.com/vdesabou/alfred-spotify-mini-player/releases/latest/download/spotifyminiplayer.alfredworkflow) the workflow

* Open `spotifyminiplayer.alfredworkflow` by double-clicking it or dragging it into Alfred.

## Setup an hotkey (optional)

It is highly recommended to use hotkeys to invoke the workflow rather than the default keyword `spot_mini`.

To setup main hotkey, see example below (click to see in fullscreen):-

<figure>
	<a href="{{ site.url }}/images/setup_hotkeys1.gif"><img src="{{ site.url }}/images/setup_hotkeys1.gif"></a>
	<figcaption>Setup main hotkey.</figcaption>
</figure>

For more hotkeys, check this [page](https://alfred-spotify-mini-player.com/articles/hotkeys/)

## Follow setup process

   * Invoke the workflow by using the keyword `spot_mini`, or better, the hotkey you set up in previous step, and type enter:

<figure>
	<a href="{{ site.url }}/images/setup13.jpg"><img src="{{ site.url }}/images/setup13.jpg"></a>
	<figcaption>Application setup.</figcaption>
</figure>

  * Your browser (except Safari) will open and you will be guided through the configuration.

  * Enjoy 🍻 !
